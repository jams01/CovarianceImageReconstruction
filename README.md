# CovarianceImageReconstruction

This is the matlab code for paper "Covariance Estimation from Compressive Data Partitions using a Projected Gradient-based Algorithm",

![Semantic description of image](./imagen.jpeg)

To run de code, first download de folder codedAperture and place it inside the folder [link]

then run the formatSensingMatrix function (this will extract the partitions and store them)

Finally, run the script main_reconstruction

This repo include data of hyperspectral images captured with a compressive architecture and the calibrated coded apertures.
