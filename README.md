# CovarianceImageReconstruction
This is the matlab code for paper  "Covariance Estimation from Compressive Data Partitions using a Projected Gradient-based Algorithm", 

To run de code, first download de folder codedAperture and place it inside the folder
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YEMCqjjvhExDAwNe4OBu0neqD0G_5lE4?usp=sharing

then run the formatSensingMatrix function (this will extract the partitions and store them)


Finally, run the script main_reconstruction


This repo include data of hyperspectral images captured with a compressive architecture and the calibrated coded apertures.
